# Memory policy

`MEMORY.md` is the switch and the policy for durable memory in this workspace. While it exists, session start puts recent memory in front of every session and `/iwe:distill` writes here; delete it and both go silent. Every run re-reads it, so an edit takes effect immediately. Nothing captures memory on its own: `/iwe:distill` reads a session *with you*, proposes, and writes only what you select.

The sections below are read by name: `/iwe:distill` follows "what to capture", "how to write it" and "dedup and updates"; `/iwe:reflect` follows "curation"; "at session start" goes in front of every session verbatim. A missing section is followed as missing.

The frontmatter carries two things, both optional: `distill`, how sessions are read: `max_chunk_size` (25000), `max_proposals` (5), `remind_after_days` (7; `-1` never, `0` every session); and `injection`, the queries session start lists, each with an optional `heading`, `limit` and `max_tokens`, here the documents under `memory/`, newest first:

``` yaml
distill:
  max_chunk_size: 25000
injection:
  - { heading: "Most recently recorded, newest first, titles and keys only:", filter: { $key: { $startsWith: memory/ } }, sort: created:-1, limit: 20 }
```

`/iwe:reflect` tunes them; an `IWE_<KNOB>` environment variable (`IWE_DISTILL_MAX_PROPOSALS`) moves a default machine-wide.

## What to capture

The few things a future session in this repository would be worse off not knowing: still true after the session ends, not obvious from the code, the README, the docs site source in `docs/`, the skill references under `skills/*/references/`, the CHANGELOG, the history or a document already here, and enough to make a future session act differently. Prefer none over noise: most sessions produce nothing durable. The opposite failure is folding: two traps and one settled question are three items, not one.

Nearly always worth keeping:

- a trap the session actually hit: a command failed, the cause was found, something made it work. The error text is its fingerprint.
- a rule stated in the conversation ("never do X", "always Y"), especially when nothing in the repository records it.
- a correction the user made: the assistant did, assumed or proposed something and the user reversed it. Write the mistaken form, in the words that were wrong, then what is right. A correction scoped to a single reply ("shorter", "not now") is not kept unless it recurs.

**A decision is recorded only when the user requested or confirmed it, in their own words.** An assistant recommendation, however well argued, is not a decision, nor is a proposal that went unanswered: drop it, or write it as an open question, never as settled.

Write nothing about the conversation itself. Memory is about the project, not the session.

## How to write it

One document per fact, keyed by a slug of its title under `memory/` (`memory/cache-warmup-order`, not `memory/2026/misc-3`). The `memory` schema in `.iwe/schemas/` binds `memory/**` and `--strict` enforces it: every document there carries `created`, stamped `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM`, and `session`, a non-empty string; a write that fails is fixed, never retried without the flag. Compose them with `--content -`, the document on stdin via a quoted heredoc:

```
iwe create memory/<slug> --strict --content - <<'EOF'
---
created: "<the occurred stamp of the span this came from>"
session: "<the session id it came from>"
---

# <Title: a specific noun phrase, not a sentence>

<Two to six sentences. State the fact, then why it matters. Quote error
messages verbatim (codes, identifiers, environment variable names) and name
the files and commands involved, so the item is findable by lexical search.>
EOF
```

`created` and `session` are copied from the header `iwe internal claude session read` prints: `created` is the `occurred` stamp: when the fact came about, not when it was written down. For something established in the live conversation, use the current time in the same `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM` shape and `$CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID`. One field never mixes date formats.

The repository's own markdown (`README`, `docs/*`, `skills/*/SKILL`, `skills/*/references/*`, `CHANGELOG`) is in the same graph. A note may link to one of those pages by its root-absolute key (`[gate model](/docs/gate-model.md)`) when the fact is about it; capture never creates or edits one.

## Dedup and updates

Search before every write, and judge the hits by reading them:

```
iwe find --lexical "<the item's distinctive nouns>" --limit 5 \
  --filter '{ $key: { $startsWith: memory/ } }' \
  --project 'title=$title,key=$key'
iwe retrieve -k <key>
```

The filter selects memory documents: everything under `memory/`. The repository's own markdown lives outside it and is never updated by memory. Update an existing document only when the new item covers the *same fact*, keeping its `created` stamp; a related but different fact is a new document.

## Provenance

`session` names the session the fact came from. `iwe find --filter '{ session: "<id>" }' -f keys` is what a session produced; a document's own `session` field is where it came from. The session's own record (what was read, offered and turned down) is `.iwe/claude/sessions/<id>.yaml`, outside the graph and outside git.

## Curation

Human-invoked, through `/iwe:reflect`. When asked, it may merge two documents that state the same fact, keeping the older key and deleting the other with `--expect 1`, at most five merges a pass, and nothing else. No pruning by age; reorganizing the store (new fields, hubs, schemas) is a human decision.

## At session start

Nothing here writes to memory on its own. When this session establishes something the policy keeps (a trap hit and fixed, a rule the user stated, a correction the user made), end that turn with a one-line offer: "Worth remembering: <title>; say the word and I'll record it." One offer per item, at most one per turn, nothing written until the user says yes. A yes runs `/iwe:distill` for that item; a no is recorded once with `iwe internal claude session complete --offered 1 --rejected "<title>"` (no `--lines`) and never re-offered.

`/iwe:distill` records something worth keeping, `/iwe:reflect` reorganizes the store.
