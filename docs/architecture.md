# Architecture

UltraCode Goal is a conductor. It orchestrates the installed BMAD epic toolbox and the TEA gates, composing Claude Code primitives — `/goal`, Auto Mode, Auto Memory, hooks, git/worktree isolation — and replaces none of them. This page covers the conductor model, the three enforcement layers in depth, the file layout, customization resolution, and why the hooks live where they do.

## The conductor model

The skill owns no implementation logic of its own for building features or running tests. What it owns is the *order*, the *gates*, and the *enforcement*. It delegates:

- **Epic toolbox** — `bmad-sprint-planning`, `bmad-create-story`, `bmad-check-implementation-readiness`, `bmad-dev-story`, `bmad-code-review`, `bmad-correct-course`, `bmad-sprint-status`, `bmad-retrospective`.
- **TEA gates** — `bmad-testarch-framework`, `-ci`, `-test-design`, `-atdd`, `-automate`, `-test-review`, `-nfr`, `-trace`.
- **Claude Code primitives** — the `/goal` loop drives execution; Auto Mode and ultracode session effort make the unattended run possible; Auto Memory carries learnings forward; hooks enforce invariants; git branches and worktrees provide isolation and rollback.

Because it is a conductor, the truth of "is this done" lives in the artifacts its delegates produce, not in the conductor's own reasoning. That is the whole design: the model arranges the work, but a script reads the verdict.

## The three enforcement layers

These are the module's non-negotiables. Each exists because the documented mechanics make the intuitive shortcut wrong (see [why](why-ultracode-goal.md)).

### 1. Deterministic gate truth

`scripts/gate_eval.py` reads TEA's `gate-decision.json` and maps its gate status to a routing verdict. It never re-derives TEA's thresholds and never reads the transcript. The `/goal` evaluator that drives execution can only see what the run surfaces — it cannot open the gate file — so it is structurally incapable of being the completion authority. The script is. See the [gate model](gate-model.md) for the full mapping, thresholds, and the fail-closed contract.

### 2. Hooks as invariants

Two invariants must hold for every commit, and neither can live in memory, which is context the model may or may not weigh:

- **`scripts/hooks/guard_pretooluse.py`** (PreToolUse) — inspects each `git commit`/`git push`. It denies the command on a protected branch, and denies a `git commit` when no tests-ran marker (`<impl-artifacts>/.tests-ran-<story_id>`) exists for the current story. It returns a `deny` decision in the hook JSON and also exits 2 with the reason on stderr so older clients that ignore the JSON still block.
- **`scripts/hooks/budget_stop.py`** (Stop) — counts turns and accumulated tokens for the current story against `max_turns_per_story` / `story_token_budget`. On overrun it writes an escalation marker and surfaces a message, then **lets the stop proceed**. Its documented limitation: a Stop hook fires only when Claude is already trying to stop, so it cannot interrupt a `/goal` condition mid-turn — the in-condition "stop after N turns" clause and the gate's re-loop budget are the real bounds; this hook is the third, defensive layer.

Both hooks read their config from env first (so the conductor injects per-run values) and fall back to hardcoded defaults (`main`/`master`, `25`, `1_500_000`, `ultracode/epic-`). Because of that fallback, a `customize.toml` override **silently no-ops at the enforcement layer** unless the conductor passes it through the hook env — so preflight injects `ULTRACODE_PROTECTED_BRANCHES`, `ULTRACODE_IMPL_ARTIFACTS`, `ULTRACODE_MAX_TURNS`, `ULTRACODE_TOKEN_BUDGET`, and `ULTRACODE_EPIC_BRANCH_PREFIX`.

### 3. Budget enforcement

A runaway story is bounded by three layers in order of authority: the **in-condition** "…or stop after N turns" clause inside the `/goal` condition (the real in-loop bound), the **gate re-loop budget** (a `reloop` that would exceed `max_turns_per_story` or `story_token_budget` becomes `escalate`), and the **Stop hook** as the defensive backstop described above. Rollback is git, not `/rewind` — an Epic branch off a protected branch, one commit per green story, worktree isolation under `--parallel` — because `/rewind` checkpoints miss the Bash-driven changes that make up the run.

## File layout

The skill routes from a thin entry point down to just-in-time stage files, deterministic scripts, and an experimental asset:

```
skills/ultracode-goal/
├── SKILL.md                       # Entry point: overview, conventions, run modes,
│                                  #   non-negotiables, the 6-stage table, headless contract
├── customize.toml                 # Config base layer (the [workflow] block)

├── scripts/                       # Deterministic truth (run via `uv`)
│   ├── preflight_check.py         #   mechanical preflight facts + blocker budget

│   └── hooks/
│       ├── guard_pretooluse.py    #   commit invariants (PreToolUse)

└── assets/
    └── execute-epic.workflow.js   # EXPERIMENTAL --parallel worktree fan-out
```

`SKILL.md` carries the routing and the contract; the `references/*.md` stage files carry the procedure and the testable routing conditions; the `scripts/*.py` files carry the deterministic facts the model cannot fudge; the `assets/*.js` workflow is the opt-in experimental execution path. See [how it works](how-it-works.md) for the stages and [parallel mode](parallel-mode.md) for the asset.

## Customization resolution

Configuration resolves in three layers, base → team → user, via `resolve_customization.py`:

1. **Base** — `customize.toml` in the skill root (the shipped `[workflow]` block).
2. **Team** — `{project-root}/_bmad/custom/ultracode-goal.toml`.
3. **User** — `{project-root}/_bmad/custom/ultracode-goal.user.toml`.

Merge semantics: **scalars override**, **tables deep-merge**, **arrays append**. At activation the skill runs `resolve_customization.py --skill {skill-root} --key workflow`; if that fails, it resolves the three files itself in the same order. The shipped base layer defines the run's knobs — the TEA/artifact paths (`tea_config_path`, `trace_output_dir`, `implementation_artifacts`, `deferred_work_path`), the git guardrails (`epic_branch_prefix`, `protected_branches`), the budgets (`max_turns_per_story`, `story_token_budget`), the experimental `parallel_max_concurrency`, the `allowlist_commands`, and the `on_epic_complete` hook. Teams and users override without editing the shipped file. Remember that a budget or branch override only reaches the *enforcement* layer because preflight threads it into the hook env (see layer 2 above).

## Why the hooks live in settings.local.json (decision D6)

The PreToolUse and Stop hooks are auto-merged into `{project-root}/.claude/settings.local.json` — machine-local, gitignored, honored after the workspace trust dialog — not into a committed settings file or memory. The reasoning: these hooks are **enforcement, not context**. A committed hook would impose this module's commit guard on every contributor and every unrelated session in the repo; a hook in memory would not block a commit at all. The machine-local file scopes enforcement to the machine actually running the unattended Epic, and the gitignore keeps it out of shared history. The skill re-merges them every run (idempotently) and asserts they are active before the run goes unattended — it does not assume a prior run left them in place. Because the file is machine-local and executes on your machine, review what is merged; see [SECURITY.md](../SECURITY.md).
