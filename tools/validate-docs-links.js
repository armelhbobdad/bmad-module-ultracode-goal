/**
 * Validate documentation links, in the source AND in the built site.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (issue #52)
 *
 * `validate-file-refs.js` scans `skills/` only, so nothing checked `docs/`.
 * 46 links shipped to the published site 404ing, and the build stayed green,
 * because an href that resolves nowhere is still valid HTML. Astro will not
 * fail on it and neither will markdownlint.
 *
 * A source-only check is NOT sufficient, and that is the lesson this tool
 * encodes. The first attempt at fixing those links made every href *look*
 * right in the Markdown while the site still 404'd, because the rewriting
 * plugin emitted a page-relative route (`./architecture/`) that the browser
 * resolved against the page's own directory. Only resolving the BUILT output
 * against the file tree catches that class.
 *
 * So there are two passes:
 *
 *   1. SOURCE  (docs/ *.md) - a relative `.md` target must exist on disk.
 *              Cheap, and catches a typo before a build is needed.
 *   2. BUILT   (build/site/ *.html) - every internal href must resolve to a
 *              real file. This is the pass that catches plugin bugs, base-path
 *              bugs, and anything else that only manifests as a route.
 *
 * The built pass is skipped with a warning when no build is present, so the
 * tool stays usable locally without a build step. CI builds the site, so the
 * pass runs there. Use --require-build to make a missing build an error.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node tools/validate-docs-links.js [--strict] [--verbose] [--require-build]
