/**
 * Validate documentation links, in the source AND in the built site.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (issue #52)
 *
 * `validate-file-refs.js` scans `skills/` only, so nothing checked `docs/`.
 * 46 links shipped to the published site 404ing, and the build stayed green,
 * because an href that resolves nowhere is still valid HTML. Astro will not
 * fail on it and neither will markdownlint.
 *
 * A source-only check is NOT sufficient, and that is the lesson this tool
 * encodes. The first attempt at fixing those links made every href *look*
 * right in the Markdown while the site still 404'd, because the rewriting
 * plugin emitted a page-relative route (`./architecture/`) that the browser
 * resolved against the page's own directory. Only resolving the BUILT output
 * against the file tree catches that class.
 *
 * So there are two passes:
 *
 *   1. SOURCE  (docs/ *.md, including docs/_internal/, plus CONTRIBUTING.md,
 *              README.md and, when present, changes/README.md) - every
 *              relative target must exist on disk, and every `#anchor`,
 *              same-file or on a `.md` target, must match a heading id in
 *              that file. Cheap, and catches a typo or a renamed heading
 *              before a build is needed.
 *   2. BUILT   (build/site/ *.html) - every internal href must resolve to a
 *              real file, and its `#fragment` to an id on that page. This is
 *              the pass that catches plugin bugs, base-path bugs, and anything
 *              else that only manifests as a route.
 *
 * The heading-to-id rules live here, in `extractAnchors`, so every id the
 * source pass checks is computed one way.
 *
 * The built pass is skipped with a warning when no build is present, so the
 * tool stays usable locally without a build step. CI builds the site, so the
 * pass runs there. Use --require-build to make a missing build an error.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node tools/validate-docs-links.js [--strict] [--verbose] [--require-build]
